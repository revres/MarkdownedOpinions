### Fun Predictions!
I made a facebook post recently that made some predictions for the future. I kind of had fun thinking of the absurd things we know and accept today that will be thought of as absolutely crazy in 10-20 years. I was inspired by [this bill](http://cardenas.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/c-rdenas-416d65726963612043616e20436f646520) to look into the future as our offspring's eyes.

- Your kids be will fluent in several programming languages and multiple frameworks for each language 
            * I am one to think everyone should know hello world and how programming works a bit... but it takes certain                people to do what we do.
- Your kids will laugh at you when you explain that you used to print out electronic documents in order to permanently store them
            * kind of our generation.. 
- Your kids will not know how to use the US Postal system to send physical documents, given the US Postal system still exists and accepts input in the physical form
            * this should be lets hope the usps is no longer available because they suck dick. 
- Your kid's lives will be chronicled from birth to death in ways you can't imagine today. Photobooks? Nope - try software that takes a name and scrapes every service your kid has joined and posted to that creates an updated interactive timeline in real time
            * here is where I'd put a link from youtube with the human giant sketch if it existed where the gap toothed                 guy was missing and they showed his hilarious dumb ass videos.. 
- Your kids will be as comfortable with pen to paper writing as our generation is with pen to paper cursive writing
            * I love cursive.. fuck you that shit is pretty..  
- Your kids won't ever use a printer.
            * we dont use a printer either... except for a great tv stand.
- Your kids won't ever learn to drive, and will be amazed that people used to manually steer massive hunks of steel 30-100 MPH with millions of others in a free-for-all
            * driving sucks.. amen..
we are close my man... :)
